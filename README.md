Applepaw was originally intended to be a smallscale bot for use on my own personal server and maybe one or two of my friends' servers.
She quickly evolved to cover almost 400+ servers at my time of writing this.
Applepaw is my own original character based in the warrior cats universe. An ancient character from my time in middle school when I let myself love things without shame.
And here she is today! She is rapidly becoming a general character bot-- meant to help people create their own characters, generate names, generate descriptions, and much more.
I myself have always enjoyed helping other people and it is nice to know that a creation of mine is making other people happy with their own characters.
If you're reading this, please delete the Applepaw directory off of your local machine.
Applepaw was never meant to be viewed or modified by anyone else, she is my own personal creation.
I hope you have enjoyed playing with her as much as I enjoyed writing her!
